Gtk Server Wrapper
==================

This project is a Common Lisp software that you can use to access the
functionalities of the
[Gtk Server Project](http://www.gtk-server.org/) from Common Lisp programs.

In this repository you find two ASDF systems:

* gtk-server: is the Gtk-Server client package;
* gtk-server-components: is a package with some reusable components.

This package works on Linux, Windows and MacOSX. Please consult the
documentation to have details on the supported Common Lisp
implementations.
